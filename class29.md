# Routing
- React-router: to toggle the visibility of components based on the URL/Route that the user engages with.

- React Router is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. 

- To use Browser Router properly, you eliminate your use of `<a>` tags and instead use itâ€™s built-in `<Link>` component.

- Whether you want to have bookmarkable URLs for your web app or a composable way to navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering

### Instillation
`$ npm install  react-router`
