## Forms and Inputs

### FORMS
- An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a controlled component.
- HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.
- This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form.


### PROP
- Components accept arbitrary inputs called props. 
- In JSX, props are passed into a component with a syntax that looks like HTML attributes. 

- Props is the name of the object passed into a component constructor and any prop added to a component in the JSX will be accessible as a property on props. After props is passed into the constructors super function, they are available on the context by using `this.props`.
