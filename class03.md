## Why would a developer choose to make data models?
1. improves the conceptual quality of an application.
2. lets you leverage database features that improve data quality.

## What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
To make the models able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete resources.

## What kind of database is Postgres? 
object-relational database

## What kind of database is MongoDB?
document-oriented

## What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects.

## Define three related pieces of data in a possible application!
for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.

data model               |    is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
CRUD                     |    create, read, update, and delete are the four basic functions of persistent storage
schema                   |    schema of a database is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system.
sanitize                 |    is any computer data
SQL                      |    domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system
NoSQL                    |    a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
MongoDB                  |    cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program
Mongoose                 |    pending connection to the test database running on localhost
Record                   |    a group of related data held within the same structure
Document                 |    type of nonrelational database that is designed to store and query data as JSON-like documents.
ORM                      |    technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages.
