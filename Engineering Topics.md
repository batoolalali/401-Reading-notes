# How to Solve Programming Problems?

###  Some tools to solve programming problems:
1. Common mistakes
    - spend upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.
    - Conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.
2. A simple set of steps
    - Read the problem completely twice.
    - Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
    - Optimize the manual steps.
    - Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
    - Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
    - Optimize the real code.

3. Read the problem completely twice
    - You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.
    - If you are given any examples along with the problem, make sure you have worked through the examples and understand why the answers are correct for each one.

4. Solve the problem manually
It is important that when you solve a problem manually, you recognize what your brain is actually doing to solve the problem.  You may need to write out all the things you are normally storing in your head.  You want to be aware of each step, it is easy to gloss over them.

5. Optimize the manual solution
    - It is well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.

    - Recognize that we can use a loop here to reduce the manual steps.  
        1. Write “Zebra” down.
        2. Start at the last letter in the word and create a new empty word.
        3. Append the current letter to the new word
        4. If there is a previous letter, make the previous letter the current letter and start back at 3.
6. Write pseudo-code or comments
7. Replace comments with real code
8. Optimize the real code

# Act like you make $1000/hr

- Many people waste much of their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don’t help them reach their true goals — their mission.

### What if you placed a high value on your time?
The most successful people are not busy. They’re focused.
When you’re busy, you are on autopilot. You can’t see the hours slipping away, time you’ll never get back.
Most people prize “being busy.” They proclaim it with pride, as if it’s a badge of honor.
- As You Think, So You Are
You teach people how to treat you.

You Can Do Amazing Things, But Only If You Have Time to Do Them
- You probably need to say “no” more.
Every time you say yes to something, it means you’re saying “no” to a dozen other opportunities. The world’s most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things.

People prefer the little dopamine boost of checking boxes on a to-do list than actually getting important work done.


# How to think like a programmer?
- How you solve problems?
1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

- Have a framework
- What should you do when you encounter a new problem?
    1. Understand: When you can explain it in plain English then you understand it.
    2. Plan: Don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information.
    3. Divide: Do not try to solve one big problem.
    4. If you stuck: 
        1. Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. 
        2. Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective.
        3. Research.
    5. Practice: Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!
