# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

- Undirected Graphs
undirected graph does not move in any direction.
- Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.


- Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
- Connected
A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.
- Disconnected
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.

- Acyclic Graph
An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles.
- Cyclic Graphs
A Cyclic graph is a graph that has cycles.
