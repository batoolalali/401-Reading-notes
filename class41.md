# Native Apps
- Native app development is the creation of software programs that run on specific devices and platforms. 
- Both responsive web and native apps are parameters that founders and product managers normally consider when gaging different options, especially if they are not closely involved with the technical aspects of the development process.

# React Native
- React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do.
- With the power of JavaScript, React Native lets you iterate at lightning speed. No more waiting for native builds to finish. Save, see, repeat.

# Expo
- Expo Is the dev environment
- Snack is an online sandbox
- expo-cli is the local equivalent to create-react-app (you can eject)
- Running locally, you can use your own device or the official simulator
    - Only Apple users can test iPhones
    - Anyone can test android, but you need to start up an ADB from The Android Studio IDE

# Ejecting to ExpoKit
ExpoKit is deprecated and will no longer be supported after SDK 38. If you need to make customizations to your Expo project, we recommend using the bare workflow instead.
