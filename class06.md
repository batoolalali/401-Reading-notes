## HTTP
The Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is a stateless request-response application layer protocol. HTTP is used to build distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

- HTTP Requests: The first line of the request contains METHOD, URL, and HTTP VERSION.
    - GET		
    - HEAD	
    - POST	
    - PUT	
    - DELETE
    - CONNECT	
    - OPTIONS	
    - TRACE	
    - PATCH	

- HTTP Response
The first line of the response contains the HTTP VERSION, STATUS CODE, and STATUS MESSAGE.
