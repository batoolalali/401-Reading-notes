# Component Based UI


### What is the app?
the application is a composition of components that work together to make the application work.

### React
- React is a JavaScript library.
- React is a User Interface (UI) library and a tool for building UI components.
- Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

### JSX
- JSX produces React elements
`const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;`

- JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

### SASS
Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
